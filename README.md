# Welcome to My Machine Learning Projects

Hello and welcome to my repository where I showcase some of my machine learning projects developed throughout the year.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of machine learning projects I have worked on, covering various topics and techniques.

## Projects

Here are the projects included in this repository:

- **Neural Networks from Scratch**: Two projects implementing neural networks from scratch.
- **Support Vector Machine**: A project exploring support vector machine algorithms.
- **Decision Trees**: An implementation and analysis of decision tree algorithms.
- **Clustering Techniques**: A project investigating different clustering algorithms.
- **Bayesian Classification**: An exploration of Bayesian classification methods.

## Additional Projects

In addition to the projects listed above, I have also worked on projects involving Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). However, these projects are not currently available in this repository.

Feel free to explore the projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
